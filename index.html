                    The CPI scores and ranks countries based on how corrupt a country's public sector is perceived to be by
                    experts and business executives. The CPI is the most widely used indicator of corruption worldwide. The CPI is
                    a composite index published annually by <em>Transparency International</em> since 1995. The CPI generally
                    defines corruption as <span class="emphasize">"the misuse of public power for private benefit"</span>.

                        Drawing on 13 surveys of business-people and experts assessments, the index scores on a scale of <span
                            class="emphasize">0 (highly
                            corrupt) to 100 (very clean)</span>.

                        The index takes a number of factors into account, such as <span class="emphasize">nepotism, prosecution of
                            corrupt officials,</span> and <span class="emphasize">bribery</span>.

                        There exists a correlation between the CPI and the countries' economy. Researchers found that <span
                            class="emphasize"> a higher CPI
                            generally results in </span> <span class="emphasize">a higher long-term economic growth</span>.
                            Although, the index has been
                        criticized on the
                        basis of its methodology, mainly because corruption is too complex to be captured by a single score, the
                        CPI is widely credited with putting the issue of corruption on the international policy agenda.
