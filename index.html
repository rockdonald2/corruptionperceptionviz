                    The CPI scores and ranks countries based on how corrupt a country's public sector is perceived to be by
                    experts and business executives. The CPI is the most widely used indicator of corruption worldwide. The CPI is
                    a composite index published annually by <em>Transparency International</em> since 1995. The CPI generally
                    defines corruption as <span class="emphasize quote">the misuse of public power for private benefit</span>.

                        Drawing on 13 surveys of business-people and experts assessments, the index scores on a scale of <span

                        There exists a correlation between the CPI and the countries' economy. Researchers found that <span

                        Although, the index has been
                        criticized on the
                        basis of its methodology, mainly because corruption is too complex to be captured by a single score, the
                        CPI is widely credited with putting the issue of corruption on the international policy agenda.

                        Frankly, the Democracy Index is an index that intends to measure the state of democracy in 167 countries.
                        The index categorises each country into one of four regime types: full democracy, flawed democracy, hybrid
                        regime and authoritarian regime.

                        As we can see on the chart on the right, with a few exceptions countries with a high Democracy Index also
                        have a high CPI score. This obviously means that countries with <span class="emphasize">lower perceivable

                        It is really objectionable that in less educated third-world, or less prosperous countries ordinary people
                        can perceive the true level of corruption. <span class="emphasize">Less years in schools in reality
                            result in </span><span class="emphasize">citizens less aware
                            of outside political affairs</span>. It is worth to mention and underline the connection between the
                        average
                        total years of schooling for adult population and the CPI.

                    <p class="context--info">
                        Also, we can expect a similar correlation between education and CPI, as we saw in the second chart, on the
                        world map, when we examined the connection between a higher HDI and a higher CPI. Education, generally the
                        average years of schooling, is one of the main factors of HDI.

                    <p class="context--info">
                        Arguably, one can say that it is forced to see a connection between an education mean and CPI, because CPI
                        is measured the corruption perceived by experts and business executives. However, it is not rare or more
                        precisely unseen for ordinary people to end up in those positions, this means that it is definitely worth
                        a look.
